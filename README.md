the idea of the project came into my mind while watching video of freecodecamp by herbertech , and i had some help from ai for some things

### installation

- write a bash script using nvim which is attached named login.bash

- then add the path of the code to the ~/.zshrc file , for bash shell users , add the  path to the ~/.bashrc file 
for example if the code's path is /home/username/file 
then the following command have to be added tothe end of the ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file

```

after adding this line source the ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc file

```bash
source ~/.zshrc

or
